# Introduction

**Project**: [Predicting the Prices of Used Cars](https://sthakur.work/project/predicting-prices-of-used-cars/)

**Detailed notebook**: [How to Predict the Prices of Used Cars](https://www.kaggle.com/shamaa/how-to-predict-prices-of-used-cars/)

In this project, my goal was to build a price-prediction model based on a dataset about cars on the US market. As the dataset had labeled data, I used supervised-learning techniques to take the project to completion.

I wanted the most accurate model. So, instead of building just one model, I built three models and assessed their performance.

Finally, I chose a model that promised the highest degree of accuracy as well as efficiency. The three models that I built in this project are a linear regressor, a random-forest regressor, and an XGBoost regressor.

In the steps that lead up to model selection, I cleaned data, employed Extratreesregressor and BayesianRidge to impute missing values with estimates, uniformized variables, and removed outliers.

## Project objectives

The main objectives of this project were as follows:

- Identify relevant machine-learning algorithms for the project.

- Build price-prediction models based on the chosen algorithms.

- Validate the models.

- Identify the most appropriate model.

## Implementation strategy

To achieve the project objectives, I worked through the following steps:

1. Identify machine-learning algorithms that can help predict car prices.

2. Obtain a dataset about used cars.

3. Explore and clean the dataset.

4. Visualize the dataset and clean it further.

5. Split the dataset for training and testing.

6. Build and validate price-prediction models.

7. Identify the most appropriate model.

## Datasets

- You can obtain the initial version of the dataset that I used in this project from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data).

- Cleaned and pruned versions of the original dataset are available in this GitHub repository in CSV format. I generated these datasets during the course of the project.
  
- A matrix comparing the errors and accuracies of the three models is also available in this repository as a CSV file.
